                    <p className='text-lg w-11/12'>Our journey began with a frightening incident â€“ a hospital visit due to an unlisted ingredient. 
                    This experience, shared by me and my sisters, was a wake-up call. It led us to create Sarah Certified, a beacon of 
                    safety in the culinary world. Our mission is simple: to ensure that every meal out is a pleasure, free from the 
                    anxiety of allergen exposure.</p>
